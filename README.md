# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App repository!

A **Todo App** is a digital tool designed to help users organize tasks and manage their daily activities more efficiently.

Whether you're managing daily chores, work projects, or personal goals, this **Todo App** makes task management easy so you can stay organized and productive.

Key Features:

1. **Adding a Task**: Start by clicking on the input field at the top. Enter the task description and press `Enter` to add it to your list.

2. **Completing/Deleting a Task**: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. To remove a task, click the delete icon `âœ•` that appears when hovering over the task.

3. **Editing a Task**: Easily update task description by double-clicking on the task you want to edit. Make your changes and press `Enter` to save the updated task.

4. **Filtering Tasks**: Use the filter buttons at the bottom of the app to view tasks based on their status:

- `All`: Shows all tasks, regardless of completion status.
- `Active`: Displays tasks that are not completed.
- `Completed`: Shows tasks that have been marked as completed.

5. **Toggle All Tasks**: The `Toggle All` button is located next to the input field at the top of the app and is represented by an arrow down icon. This button allows users to mark all tasks as completed or clear all completed statuses with a single click. This feature is particularly useful for quickly managing the completion status of multiple tasks at once.

6. **Clear Completed Tasks**: The `Clear Completed` button, located at the bottom of the app, removes all tasks from the list that have been marked as completed.

7. **Number Of Unfinished Tasks**: The app provides a quick overview of tasks that still need to be completed by displaying the number of unfinished tasks at the bottom of the app.
